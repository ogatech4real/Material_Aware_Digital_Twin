# Materials-Aware Digital Twin for Solar–Battery Systems  
**A reproducible framework for lifecycle-aware optimisation of photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage systems**

---

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the **Materials-Aware Digital Twin (MAT-DT)** framework proposed in the IEEE Access manuscript:  
**“Materials-Aware Digital Twin for Solar–Battery Systems: Integrating Equipment Ageing into Smart Energy Optimisation.”**

The project integrates physical degradation models for both batteries and photovoltaic (PV) modules directly into an optimisation-based control system.  
It demonstrates how digital twins can move beyond monitoring to perform **active lifecycle management**, balancing short-term cost efficiency with long-term equipment health and carbon reduction.

---

## Research Motivation

Conventional energy management systems optimise PV–battery operation for short-term savings (e.g., tariff arbitrage) while ignoring battery wear and PV derating.  
Over time, this leads to reduced capacity, efficiency loss, and hidden lifecycle costs.

This project introduces a **materials-aware digital twin** that:
- Models real degradation processes (battery and PV ageing).  
- Uses forecasts and optimisation to inform daily operational decisions.  
- Quantifies trade-offs between cost, carbon emissions, and asset lifetime.  
- Provides a reproducible simulation platform ready for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) integration.

---

## Core Features

- **Reduced-order ageing models** for battery and PV degradation (calendar + cycle ageing; temperature and environmental stress effects).  
- **Rolling-horizon optimisation** using [Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/) for cost–carbon–lifecycle balancing.  
- **Forecasting module** for solar generation, load demand, and tariffs.  
- **Bootstrap validation and Pareto analysis** for statistical confidence and trade-off exploration.  
- **Modular design**—each script handles a specific task (generation, modelling, optimisation, evaluation).  
- **Reproducible results** aligned with figures and tables presented in the IEEE Access paper.

---

## Methodology Summary

The framework follows a structured digital twin architecture linking six key modules:

1. **Data Generation:** Creates standardised 15-minute datasets representing PV, load, and tariff profiles.  
2. **Degradation Modelling:** Quantifies battery capacity fade and PV derating using empirical relationships.  
3. **Forecasting:** Predicts near-term irradiance, load, and tariffs using statistical or ML methods.  
4. **Optimisation:** Solves a rolling-horizon problem to minimise total cost, carbon emissions, and degradation.  
5. **Control Execution:** Applies the first decision at each step, updating system states iteratively.  
6. **Evaluation:** Computes KPIs (economic, lifecycle, environmental) and performs statistical validation.

## The workflow can be executed entirely via:

  ``bash
python main.py
All figures and tables in the paper can be regenerated from the results/ and figs/ directories.

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

  1. **Economic**: Annual electricity cost, arbitrage revenue, peak import reduction, LCOS.
  2. **Lifecycle**: Battery capacity fade (%), equivalent full cycles, PV performance ratio decline.
  3. **Environmental**: Avoided CO₂ emissions (kgCO₂e).
  4. **Reliability**: Demand served (%), reserve margin compliance.

## Simulation Results (Summary)

  - Battery wear reduction by 10–20% compared to the cost-only control.
  - PV degradation slowed by ≈0.1%/year.
  - Cost difference < 3% from baseline while improving lifetime economics.
  - Results statistically validated via bootstrapping and Pareto trade-off analysis.

## Implementation Environment

- Language: Python 3.10+
- Optimisation Engine: Pyomo (CBC solver)
- Key Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- Runtime: Tested on Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04
- Hardware: 8GB RAM minimum; optional Raspberry Pi deployment for real-time control

---

## Hardware Integration (Optional)

The framework is ready for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) validation.
  - A typical setup includes:
  - Raspberry Pi as edge controller running the optimisation engine.
  - Arduino UNO WiFi as sensor/actuator interface for voltage, current, and temperature measurements.
  - Communication: MQTT, Modbus, or REST API between the physical system and the digital twin.
  - This setup enables real-time testing of lifecycle-aware control strategies.
